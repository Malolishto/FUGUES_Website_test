# Welcome To FUGUES!
  
</br>

##### FUGUES (Functional Genomics Using Endosymbionts) is an effort by the 

##### Barrick and Moran labs at the University of Texas at Austin to elucidate 

##### the function of genes in Honey bees and Bumble bees by taking advantage

##### of their gut symbionts to induce gene knockdown via RNA interference.

##### The project hopes to standardize a method for gene knockdown in bees that

##### can be done not just by molecular biologist but by all EDGE researchers.
