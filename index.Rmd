# Welcome! I am Jacob Risch. 
  
</br>

##### I weigh almost 170 pounds and I can eat an unlimited amount of oysters at any given time.

##### I enjoy learning at UT, texting pen pals and working out. 

##### I like everyone! And I, like Bevo, hold no advanced degrees.  

##### I don't have any data-related projects either, but if I did you could find them [here](/portfolio)!
